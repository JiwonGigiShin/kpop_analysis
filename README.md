### Is girlgroup targeting less *hetero-normative* concept?

| Keyword | Neoliberal feminism, Empowerment |
| --- | --- |
| Time (Era) | 2005 - 2022 (current) |
| Samples | below |
| Language | Korean, English, Chinese, Spanish, Japanese |
| Hypothesis | 1) “feminism would have influenced the female audiences, and now the target audiences of girl groups are not male(a.k.a OPPA) fans anymore.”, 2) ”Empowering lyrics would have a positive effect on feminism even though it is still self-objectification (i.e what audiences say about the lyrics?”), 3) ”Empowering concepts might have influenced significantly for K-pop to go global (than pedophilic concept.. which is considered cringe in western context*, Sadly, Koreaboos love it)” |


<Timeframe>

1) ~2010 Sexy, neoliberal, Diva 
powerful but sexualised concept
still singing about hetero-normative love. (i.e “You are a bad boy!!!! but I can live without you! I’m still popular with guys and I’m gonna go clubbing with my gals! (Go away - 2NE1)”)

e.g Miss A, 2NE1, Sistar, after school, Hyun a, 손담비


2) 2010~2015 
both concepts existed 
constant battle between cute and sexy! (+ 뽕빨의 시대)
SNSD - Oh! (”I love O-O-O-Oppa”), OPPA 나빠
IU - Good day (”I like you OPPA”)
Girl’s day - https://m.news.nate.com/view/20110530n07217?mid=e02 Vs https://pickcon.co.kr/m/view.html?contid=2014010601289
T-Ara - Bo-peep Bo-peep (Cute) Vs Roly Poly / 야야야 (뽕빨) Vs (sexy)
In case of a sexy concept, it was submissive, male-gaze sexy concept it was very likely to be blamed for ‘선정성 논란’ (controversially sensationalised) - AOA (mini skirt), Stellar, 
e.g. Girl’s day, SNSD, T-Ara, 시크릿

3) 2015 ish~ girlish (or Lolita..) passive, submissive “I’m young! I’m cute! I’m singing for my OPPA!”
e.g. APINK, IU, GFriend, WJSN, Oh my girl, Loona, IOI TWICE (early), Red Velvet (early)

4) 2020s AGAIN neoliberal Feminism
Proactive, empowering, powerful, invigorate lyrics
not ‘hetero-normative’ or even not singing about ‘love’ anymore, because the target audiences changed (i.e “I’m not afraid, I’m gonna climb up to the top (Fearless, Antifragile - Le serafim), Girls! follow me! (Girls - Aespa), I’m a narcissist and in love with myself (Love dive- Ive) You’re the pervert so get gone, and I can wear what I want (Nude- (G)idle, I’m so rich and beautiful SWAG (BLACKPINK)”
e.g MAMAMOO, Blackpink, Aespa, Le Serafim, (G)Idle, Dreamcatcher, NMIXX TWICE (late), Red Velvet (late)

## The correlation between ‘페미(Feminism)’ & Female celebs

[](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&geo=KR&q=%ED%8E%98%EB%AF%B8)

‘페미’ is a word that stands for ‘Feminism’ but is mostly interpreted in a pejorative way.

![Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 15.20.47.png](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/afbbfe80-5dd1-4c5c-bd2b-b1c733e0109c/Screenshot_2022-12-27_at_15.20.47.png)

Since certain point in Korean history (I’d say 2015 -Jiwon), the ‘feminism’ agenda became an emerging issue. 

“Virtuous circle” was made like below.

Female audiences: “We don’t want to listen to male-gaze narratives, submissive lyrics and concepts are disgusting! We want more female-centred, female-oriented and admirable girl groups so that we can project ourselves to them”

Female artists: “We don’t have to sing about hetero-normative love nor male-gaze narratives anymore. *Let’s talk about **ourselves**.*” (Some female artists did express their opinions regarding feminism in direct/indirect ways and even were terrorised by anti-feminist netizens (e.g. Seolhyun (AOA), Son Na-Eun(Apink), Irene(Red Velvet), Chaeyoung(TWICE))

Entertainment companies (a.k.a manufacturers) : “Seems like female-oriented concepts are more lucrative as those female fans bring a lot of money to us compared to male fans. We don’t have to focus on male-gaze concepts anymore, or even we SHOULDN’T do something which will annoy female audiences. We can make the best use of feminism for our profitability.”

TIMES said, *“(G)I-DLE impresses not just with performance but with production. While the group begins to challenge stereotypes in the lead single ‘Tomboy’, where they refuse to become a ‘blond barbie doll’ to meet societal standards, (G)I-DLE builds upon the rebellious energy in the tracks that follow.”*






## K-indie Analysis
### Popular music is a reflection of society, a barometer for our collective wants, fears, and emotional states?

This study aims to investigate the relationship between music trends and socio-economic and political issues, as conveyed through the lyrics of Korean music between the years 2008 and 2022.
 
This study employs a methodological approach that involves the use of Korean Music Awards nominees as the primary source, from which a sample of artists who performed at either the Pentaport Rock Festival or Grand Mint Festival, within the same year or one year before or after, is selected. Since its inception in 2004, the Korean Music Awards has prioritised the music itself over the commercial popularity of the artist, and consequently, the awards are categorised based on genre. This approach provides a comprehensive and diverse collection of primary sources for analysis. The study obtained a list of nominees from the Korean Music Awards from 2008 to 2022 and subsequently selected artists who were listed on the festival line-up as a standard for examining the representativeness and popularity of the artists among the public.
 
The Pentaport Rock Festival, held annually since 2006, is one of the largest rock festivals in Korea. The Grand Mint Festival, established in 2007, is a representative urban music festival that combines pop and indie music and provides an alternative festival for a general audience who may not have a specific music preference. The selected sources for examination are nominees who have performed at either of the festivals within the same year or one year before or after the year of nomination. Due to a smaller number of sources for the years 2008 and 2022, the winners of the year or those who received great popularity from the nominee list were manually added to the sources. In total, 193 artists, including repetitions, were included in the list for further analysis.
